"""Constants for the HA WhatsApp integration.

All configuration keys, domain identifiers, and default values used
across the integration are defined here to avoid magic strings in
multiple places.

Constants:
    DOMAIN: Unique integration domain used in ``hass.data`` and service
        registrations.
    CONF_API_KEY: Config-entry key for the addon API key.
    CONF_SESSION_ID: The unique session identifier for the WhatsApp instance.
    CONF_MASK_SENSITIVE_DATA: Whether to mask phone numbers in logs.
    CONF_DEBUG_PAYLOADS: Whether to log raw outgoing payloads for debugging.
    CONF_POLLING_INTERVAL: Options-entry key for the event-poll interval
        in seconds.
    DEFAULT_PORT: Default port on which the WhatsApp addon listens.
    CONF_URL: Config-entry key for the base URL of the addon REST API.
    CONF_MARK_AS_READ: Options-entry key that controls automatic
        ``mark-as-read`` behaviour for incoming messages.
    CONF_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: Options-entry key for the number of retry
        attempts on send failures.
    CONF_WHITELIST: Options-entry key for a comma-separated list of
        allowed phone numbers / JIDs.

        to the account's own number should be processed.
